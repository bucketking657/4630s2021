\section{Summary}
In this article the author talks about how Machine learning in the medical field has been facing a problem. the problem is that a lot of the result generated are not reproducible which inadvertently affects patients treatment and doctors ability to make decisions. In a journal presented by Science Translation Medicine it was found that 85 percent of studies done using machine learning to detect Covid in chest x-ray failed both reproducibility and quality check. I think this was interesting because it shows that there is still a lot of work to done with machine learning and yet it is already being used in the medical field. It also shows that there is a problem within the scientific community because these machines have been out in the workforce for years now and only recently has this been detected. This is relevant because as computer scientist we are responsible for making sure that our work passes these kinds of reproducibility checks. It shows that if we we do not thoroughly test and vett our code that we can not just be in trouble at work but also put other people and even ourselves at risk of receiving lower quality care from our doctors.
