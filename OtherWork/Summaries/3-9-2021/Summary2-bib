\section{Summary}
This is an interesting article because it proposes a new way to look at the fatalities caused from the pandemic. The researchers put forth a new equation called the COVID-19 burden which they claim offers significant advantages over conventional fatality measures because it takes into account a variety of latent mortality factors.I think this article is relevant topic because these scientist are using big data in a new way to further refine an old statistical model which is something as a Engineer or scientist we should always be trying to do. The way that they take this same data other researchers have access it to and aggregate and analyses gives us new insight into how this pandemic has effected specific countries mortality rates compared to before the pandemic. This new way of looking at the data set provides us new insights and personally gives me the idea of not just to try and interpret data in the way it has always been but to try and find new ways to look at it, as well as the different patters that come from this new perspective.

\section{Abstract}
As the world struggles with the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, public health officials and governments continue to refine the key
metrics that are used to capture and compare the state of the pandemic and the effects of responses within and between
countries and regions. This work presents a novel fatality metric, the COVID-19 burden, which normalises SARS-CoV2 fatalities with respect to historical mortality rates over the same period of time. We argue that this measure provides an improved
basis for comparing fatality rates between countries, and we present an analysis of this measure across 174 countries, using
data up to November 15, 2020, to better understand the impact of the virus in different countries and regions.
